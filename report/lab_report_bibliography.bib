	abstract = {Gravitar (working title Lunar Battle) is a color vector graphics arcade game released by Atari, Inc. in 1982. Using the same "rotate-and-thrust" controls as Asteroids and Space Duel, the game was known for its high level of difficulty. It was the first of over twenty games (including the 1983 Star Wars) Mike Hally designed and produced for Atari. The main programmer was Rich Adam and the cabinet art was designed by Brad Chaboya. Over 5,427 cabinets were produced. An Atari 2600 version, ported by Dan Hitchens, was published by Atari in 1983.},
